# Open Source Software Development

This repository contains assignments and projects of the Open Source Software Development lesson. I also developed a mobile application where these assignments are listed. Thanks to the web api that I have set up on my server, the mobile application can receive the output of the commands run on the Ubuntu machine by sending a request to the api.

## Exec Script File

A script file is run like this:

```bash
chmod +x script.sh # add to executable permission
./script.sh # run script file
```

## Mobile App Usage

It is necessary to log in to the system via the mobile application with a username and password defined in the system.

Username and password defined in the system:

```
userName = dogukaneren
password = Deren.25
```
