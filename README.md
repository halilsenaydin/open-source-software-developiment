# open-source-software-developiment
This repository contains assignments and projects of the Open Source Software Development lesson. I also developed a mobile application where these assignments are listed. Thanks to the web api that I have set up on my server, the mobile application can receive the output of the commands run on the Ubuntu machine by sending a request to the api.
